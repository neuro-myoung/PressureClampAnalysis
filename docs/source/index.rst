Pressure Clamp Analysis
====================================

This is a small package to analyze pressure clamp data generated in HEKA
patchmaster software using python. Currently, the package includes p50 and single-
channel analysis. 

For an example analysis pipeline see the Jupyter Notebook in the examples folder.
You can view the notebook online with interactive plots by going to https://nbviewer.org/ and pasting the
